# [Wynntils Functions](https://wynntils-functions.ryanzhou.dev/)

This is a small, automatically generated documentation site for the [Wynntils/Artemis](https://github.com/Wynntils/Artemis/) info box functions.
Function and argument descriptions are automatically taken from the `en_us.json` translation in mod itself.
There is also basic search/filtering functionality.

## How it works

The site itself pulls from a Postgres database that is automatically generated from the [Wynntils/Artemis](https://github.com/Wynntils/Artemis/) mod.
Currently, this database is hosted at [neon.tech](https://neon.tech) and has to be "manually" updated when functions are added or changed in the mod.

This is done by the [feature](https://github.com/Wynntils/Artemis/pull/1887) in Artemis that allows it to export function and argument information to CSV files.
Additionally, the feature also generates an SQL command that wipes and prepares the database for the new data.

### Instructions

First, run `/execute FunctionDump dumpFunctions` in-game.
If all goes well, you should see messages in chat confirming that two new CSV files have been created.
Additionally, the chat will give basic instructions on what to do next, as well as notify you that the SQL command has been copied to your clipboard.

Next, in [pgAdmin 4](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/), use the psql tool to run the SQL command that was copied to your clipboard.
Then, open (or refresh) the `public` schema. On each table (functions first, then arguments), right-click and select `Import/Export...`.
Point the import to the CSV file that was generated by the mod.
Ensure that the `Header` option is checked, the encoding is `UTF8`, and the format is `csv`.
Click `OK` to import the data, starting with the `functions` table.

Once database updates are complete, check that the new functions have actually appeared on the site.
If not, go to the [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard) dashboard and redeploy the site.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `components/docs.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
